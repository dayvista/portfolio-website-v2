## Off the Chain

The increased congestion of the ethereum network during the latest market bull run was hard to ignore, with [gas fees soaring](https://ycharts.com/indicators/ethereum_average_gas_price) and the rollout of Eth 2.0 [still an incremental process](https://support.hbtc.co/hc/en-us/articles/1500000083682-ETH-2-0-Upgrade-and-Roadmap). Subsequently, there has been growing adoption of more efficient side- and alt-chains that provide similar smart contract functionality at a fraction of the cost of Ethereum. Networks such as Polygon, Solana, and Fantom are offering reduced gas fees and faster transaction times (though at the cost of [certain trade-offs](https://youtube.com/watch?v=oh_QyzTEXtc)).

Although these separate blockchains solve critical issues that plague the Ethereum infrastructure, their increasing popularity represents an ongoing trend of ecosystem fractionation in the cryptocurrency space as a whole. The ongoing emergence of competing (and companion) chains dates back to the Bitcoin block size debate and the ensuing hard fork, as well as the creation of similar projects to Bitcoin such as Litecoin. The advent of Ethereum, and easily-mintable ERC-20 tokens along with it, compounded the divide between chains of choice for investors and developers.

This "ongoing fractionation" is actually beneficial to the trial and adoption of new and alternative technologies. Free choice is integral to free markets. Moving assets from one chain to another, though, is often an expensive or complicated process. Bridges between chains can lack liquidity, contain smart contract bugs, or [only support swapping a small subset of coins](https://www.xpollinate.io/).

## ThorChain: Ensuring Cross Chain Liquidity

The ThorChain blockchain and its companion DEX, ThorSwap, are en route to solve (and resolve) the issue of cross-chain swaps once and for all. Through the ThorSwap UI, ThorChain supports high-liquidity cross-chain swaps of native coins without the need for wrapped tokens or bridge dapps. Fees are charged in the native token of the chain that is being swapped from. For example, swapping from BEP2 BTCB to native BTC incurs BEP2 BNB gas fees.

Users supply liquidity by contributing to non-custodial pools. Coins are paired with RUNE, ThorChain's native asset, instead of other coins [in order to prevent scaling and valuation issues within the thorchain network](https://thorswap.finance/faq/). The developers have placed hard caps on Thorswap's liquidity pools to ensure that any bugs are worked out before the service is widely adopted. Whenever the caps are raised, the pools fill almost immediately - a testament to the public hype and growing awareness of the value that Thorchain offers.

Thorchain is an important contribution to the cryptocurrency community because it offers non-custodial cross-chain swaps with reliable liquidity. Cross-chain swaps have historically been relegated to custodial exchanges that possess the necessary liquidity through massive on-network trade volume.

## Solvency with Integrity

As Thorchain bypasses the custodial element of exchanging cross-chain assets, the process is made simultaneously more opaque to outsiders and more transparent to those involved with transactions. Instead of being shown a loading screen while exchanging assets, the transaction address can be traced through the blockchain from start to finish. KYC beyond fiat onboarding may become a thing of the past.

The price of transactional transparency is that anyone can view your wallet's holdings, so long as they know the corresponding public key. Coins like Monero and ZCash have obfuscation capabilities that are able to hide the identities of wallets involved in transactions. However, CEXs generally make trading in private currencies difficult. To allow the trading of anonymous currencies on government-regulated platforms poses obvious legal risks to CEX operators.

## A Safe Haven

[The Haven Protocol](https://havenprotocol.org/), an open-source fork of Monero, grants similar privacy benefits to its users as its parent coin does. Haven does this while expanding on the concept of private assets in a way that makes it extremely useful to DeFi.

Haven's native coin, XHV, is burned to create synths (synthetic assets) that are pegged to real world assets, such as USD and gold. Decentralization is maintained by relying on [Chainlink oracles](https://chain.link/solutions/defi) to peg synth valuations, as opposed to synths being backed by centralized holdings of physical assets. Haven offers a unique web wallet that allows users to store their xAssets (Haven synths) privately and in an untraceable fashion. Assets such as xUSD and xAU can be exchanged in-wallet without the need for an intermediary.

This combination of private stablecoins with a private wallet creates a truly anonymous store of value separate from the volatility of cryptocurrency markets - and protected from [the perils of government bureaucracy](https://money.cnn.com/2018/01/17/news/economy/venezuela-cash-crisis/index.html).

## Love at First Swap

If only there was a way to exchange XHV and xAssets with other coins privately... Well, that's exactly what [the emerging alliance](https://havenprotocol.org/2021/05/17/thorchain-integration-update/) between Haven and ThorChain makes possible. The trading of xAssets will be supported on Thorswap. This will provide decentralized liquidity to anonymous stablecoin assets.

Citizens under threat from an authoritarian government or similar criminal organization now have access to a completely private hedge against coercion and hyper inflation. This development will revitalize the viability of cryptocurrencies as an alternative to the fiat economic system. Erik Voorhes, Bitcoin veteran and CEO of the exchange Shapeshift, [seems to think so too](https://youtube.com/watch?v=VpFow_B4R-Q).
